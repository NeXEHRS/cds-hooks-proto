The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the circulation, unlike aspirinÅfs antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). \nunknown. \n unknown.",

In some people, acetaminophen can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, so monitor the INR if acetaminophen is used in doses over 2 g/day for a few days. For more severe pain consider short-term opioids in place of the NSAID."
